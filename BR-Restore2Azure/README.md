## Project Notes
**Author:** Dustin Albertson (@clouddizzle)

**Function:** This Script will take multiple inputs (vms) from a csv file and perform a restore to Azure process for each one.   

**Requires:** Veeam Backup & Replication v10 or v11



**Usage:** 

Edit the .csv file with the following information 

VM_NAME = Names of the machines from backups you wish to restore

vm_size = the VM type you want the instance to be in Azure (Standard_A4_v2)

Location = The location (region) you want the vm to be in (each vm can be in different locations)

Resource_Group = The resource group you want the vm to reside in

vm_subnet = The subnet you want the vm to use

vm_network = The vnet you want the vm to use

az_proxy_name = The proxy name of the veeam proxy appliance in azure. This is reccomended to improve performance. [Learn More Here](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/azure_integration/add_vbazure_appliance.html?ver=110 "Veeam Helpcenter")

az_subscription = The name of the subscription to restore to.  (each vm can be a different subscription)

az_storage_acct = The name of the storage account to restore to

az_account_login = The email address of the subscription used in veeam to connect to azure.  (each vm can be a different account/sub)

Once you have the settings placed in the dr2azure.csv you can then edit the script to add the following settings

#Please Update the variables below 
$vbrserver = “localhost”
#VBR ServerName
$vbruser = “USERNAME”
#VBR Username
$vbrpwd = “PASSWORD”
#VBR Password
$cust_csv = "C:/example/dr2ec2.csv"
#Location of the csv file with the AWS/vm details


Once these settings have been added you simply run the powershell script from the console by ./dr2azure.ps1
