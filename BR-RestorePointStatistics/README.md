# get-RPstatistics.ps1

PowerShell script to retrieve a summary of all existing Veeam  backup restore points

This script enumerates all existing restore points and creates two output files in CSV format 
  - **_VBR-Servername_-RestorePoints.csv**:
    a list of all restore points incl. type of backup,
    backup file size, creation time, compression and dedupe ratios,
    change rates (for incremental restore points only) and
    a few blocksize calculations (for object storage sizing assistance)
  - **_VBR-Servername_-statistics.csv**:
    backup volume, average change and reduction rates per vm and job
    (separated for full and incremental restore points)

Mandatory parameters:
- `vbrServer` = Veeam backup server name or IP to connect to

Optional parameters:
- `suppressGridDisplay` = switch to not show GridViews after processing
- `outputDir` = where to write the output files (folder must exist, otherwise defaulting to script folder)

> **Note:** Running the script will take some time depending on the number of existing restore points in your environment. Expect a processing rate of ~500 restore points per minute (just my average experience; you might get totally different results!).

Requires [Veeam Powershell module].
