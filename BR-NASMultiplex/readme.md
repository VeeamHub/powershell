## Project Notes
**Author:** Timothy Dewin (@tdewin)

**Function:** Add shares from the root domain to the same job via a gui. Tested only with SMB, might work with NFS

**Requires:** Veeam Backup & Replication v10

**Usage:** 
Running the GUI (or right click in explorer and run with powershell)
```
.\br-nasmultiplex.ps1
```

Sourcing the code so you can use add-nasmultiplexshares manually
```
. .\BR-NASMultiplex\br-nasmultiplex.ps1 -nogui
```

**Parameters:**
* -nogui : Just load the script but don't start the gui. If you source the code instead of running, you can than use Add-NasMultiplexShares to manually add multiple shares


**Sample:**
