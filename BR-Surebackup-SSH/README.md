## Project Notes
**Author:** Timothy Dewin

**Function:** Allows you to verifiy linux vms but executing shell commands via ssh

**Requires:** 
Backup & Replication v10

Renci.SshNet.dll -> should be shipped with B&R v10 and detected by the script

**Watch out**
Password is plaintext passed. You might want to secure it a bit better or lock down the rights of the user correctly

**Usage:** Schedule the script via the Application Group or via the "Surebackup" job > "Linked Job" section.

For example : 
-server %vm_ip% -username timothy -password Root123!


**Parameters:**

* -server %vm_ip%
	* What is the masked IP of the SQL server, use %vm_ip% in the Surebackup setup.
* -user user
	* What is the mysql user
* -password password
	* What is the mysql password
* -servicecheck
	* What do you want to execute (default 'service mysql status')
* -matchoutput
	* Regex match on the output (default 'active [(]running[)]' which just confirms that the serivce is running)
