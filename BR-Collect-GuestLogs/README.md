# Collect-GuestLogs

# ðŸ“— Documentation
## **Versions supported**
This script has been tested to work on Windows Server/Workstation operating systems that use PowerShell version 4.0 or higher.

## **Purpose**
This script helps automate and simplify the Guest OS log collection process documented in [Veeam KB1789](https://www.veeam.com/kb1789).

## **Description:**
Automated collection of Windows-based logs for troubleshooting of Veeam Backup jobs with _Application Aware Processing_ enabled (ie. SQL/Exchange/Active Directory/SharePoint/Oracle).

## **Requirements** <br>
Local Administrator permissions and permission to execute scripts in an elevated PowerShell console.

## **Usage:** <br>

1. **[Download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeeamHub/powershell/master/BR-Collect-GuestLogs/Collect-GuestLogs.ps1)** (Right-click link > '_Save link as_') and save it to the Windows machine where logs need to be collected.
2. Open an Administrative PowerShell Console, and navigate to the directory where the script was saved. 
     - (**NOTE**: Running the script in PowerSell ISE is **NOT** supported due to the additional modules that PowerShell ISE loads that can conflict with the script's execution.)
4. Run the following to execute the script:
     (Note: PowerShell's Execution Policy is set to _RemoteSigned_ by default on Windows Server machines. This is the reason _Unblock-File_ command is ran prior to calling the script.)
```
Unblock-File .\Collect-GuestLogs.ps1
.\Collect-GuestLogs.ps1
```
4. While the script runs, the PowerShell console will display information about what's happening during each step of the process. 
5. [Attach the generated **.zip** file to the Veeam support case.](https://www.veeam.com/kb4162)

## **Features** <br>
This script will collect the following information from the machine:

* Collects _GuestHelper_, _GuestIndexer_ and other logs located in _%ProgramData%\Veeam\Backup\_ (or alternate configured directory)
* Collects output of various VSSAdmin commands: Writers/Shadows/ShadowStorage/Providers
* Collects output of SystemInfo.exe
* Collects various registry values (_Veeam Backup and Replication_, _SCHANNEL_ and _System_ hives specifically) to check for various settings that affect In-Guest Processing
* Checks for Veeam registry values which may have leading or trailing whitespace which would cause them not to work as intended
* Collects list of installed software
* Collects permissions for all SQL users for each database if one or more running SQL instances have been detected
* Collects information about connected volumes
* Collects list of accounts with Local Administrator permissions
* Collects status of Windows Services
* Checks if '_File and Printer Sharing_' is enabled/disabled
* Collects Event Viewer logs
