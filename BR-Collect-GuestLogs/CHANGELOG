July 19 2022 Update:

- Added code to resize the PowerShell console. If the PowerShell console buffer size / window size was too small, the output from many of the commands would be truncated to the point that the information would not be useful.
- Reworked the way registry values are exported. Now uses 'reg.exe export <path\to\reg\hive>' as it gives better output and is more useful.
- Included export of 32-bit Veeam registry values (HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Veeam)

Regression testing performed on: 
    - Server 2012 R2 running PowerShell 4.0
    - Server 2019 running PowerShell 5.1
    - Windows 10 Pro for Workstations running PowerShell 5.1
