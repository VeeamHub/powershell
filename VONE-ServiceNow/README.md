# Service Now Incident creation and resolution
By Carlos Talbot (carlos@talbot.net)
The two scripts in this folder are required for setting up Veeam One to automatically create and resolve
Service Now incident tickets.

Copy createticket.ps1 and resolveticket.ps1 to a local directory on the VeeamOne server (e.g. c:\scripts).

IMPORTANT:
You will need to run the script createticket.ps1 for the first time interactively from a PowerShell command line.
The script will prompt you for the username and password of your SNOW instnace which is then stored in an encrypted
file in the same directory as the script. You need to run this as the same account as the VeeamOne service is running 
as (e.g. LOCAL Administrator). Below is an example you can use to run the script:  

c:\scripts\createticket.ps1 "VM power status" "EXCH2K16" "virtual machine is not Running" "1/29/2020 9:56:38 PM" "Error" "Reset/Resolved" "21117"  

Once this is completed you will find the file SNOWCredentials.xml within the script directory.

Configuring Veeam One
In order to integrate the scripts with Veeam One you will need to edit an alarm by adding the two entries in the alarm
notification tab as shown in the image below. The full line for each script is as follows (change path to scripts as
required). Don't forget to enable the alarm.

powershell.exe C:\scripts\createticket.ps1 '%1' '%2' '%3' '%4' '%5' '%6' '%7'  
powershell.exe C:\scripts\resolveticket.ps1 '%1' '%2' '%3' '%4' '%5' '%6' '%7'

If you nee to troubleshoot the execution of the scripts, you can set a variable in each of the scripts to enable writing to a debug file (SNOWdebug.log) by setting the variable $Debug = $true
