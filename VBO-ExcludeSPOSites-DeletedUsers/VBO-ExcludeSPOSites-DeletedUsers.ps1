.DESCRIPTION
*** Please note this script is unofficial and is not created nor supported by Veeam Software. ***
This script automatically excludes from backup Sharepoint Online personal sites belonging to non-existing (deleted) users.
For help or comments, contact the author on Twitter (@danilochiavari) or via e-mail (danilo.chiavari -at- gmail (.) com)
This script has been tested with the following versions of Veeam Backup for Office 365:
   - v5.0.1.225

Notes:
   - You will be prompted to log in to Azure AD and Sharepoint Online. You can use either a standard credential or one secured by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
   - Organization / Office 365 Tenant and Sharepoint Online Admin URLs are automatically obtained based on the supplied credential
.PARAMETER Job
(optional) The backup job where exclusions will be created. If not specified (or the provided one does not exist) the script will let you pick from a list of existing jobs for the selected Organization
.PARAMETER MFA
(optional) When set to $True, allows use of a MFA-secured user account when logging in. If not specified, a standard (non-MFA) user account is assumed (Thanks to user @kosli for implementing and testing MFA, plus fixing an issue with obtaining admin URLs)
