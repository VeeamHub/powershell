Function: Script to use for automatically and dynamically adding specific Mailbox Recipient types like SharedMailbox, EquipmentMailbox, RoomMailboxes to a VBO backup job. 

Description: With this script, these RecipientType details are pulled from O365, stored in a temp file, and then compared to your VBO job:
If not added yet to the job, this script will automatically add the UPN to the job.
If already added to the job, this script will filter out those accounts already added.
If a specific Mailbox may not be added to the job, write this UPN in the Filter file created by this script. With each run, the script will compare the newly found mailboxes against the filter list and exclude all that matches the filter.

During the first run of this script, the script will automatically create a folder structure in which the temp-output file, log files, filter files, and credential files are stored. Please feel free to adjust those folders and file names to your own needs.

Second, during the first interactive run of the script, the script will ask for the O365 credentials to be used for pulling the information from O365. It's recommended that you use an MFA-Enabled service account with a preconfigured App password to securely login to O365. See the following link to create an App password for an MFA-Enabled service account: http://vee.am/App-Password.
 
The credentials used during this first run will be stored encrypted in the cred.xml file stored in the Cred folder and will be used each run (interactive or scheduled). If you want to change the credentials used, just delete the credentials file and run the script interactively again to add the new credentials to be used.

This script will automatically create audit logs in which you can found which account is added on which run and which accounts are skipped due to the filter match. 

To use the filter just add the upn of the user or mailbox you want to exclude on a row by row bases.

Full list of tested RecipientType values:
EquipmentMailbox,GroupMailbox,RoomMailbox,SharedMailbox,TeamMailbox,UserMailbox

You can specify multiple values separated by commas in the script.

Requires: Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 and ExchangeOnlineManagement 1.0.1 PowerShell modules.
