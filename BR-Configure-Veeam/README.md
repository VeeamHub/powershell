# Automated Configuration of Veeam Backup & Replication Server Infrastructure, Repositories and Jobs
PowerShell script to configure a freshly installed Veeam Backup & Replication Server ready for use with local and cloud based repositories with default Tag based Backup Job Policies created

    Performs a number of configuration actions against a Veeam Backup & Replication Server as per the included functions.

    - Attach a vCenter
    - Add and configure Cloud Connect Backup and/or Replication Provider
    - Add and configure a Linux Based Repository
    - Create vSphere Tag Catagories and Tags
    - Create a set of default Tag Based Policy Backup Jobs
    - Clears all configured settings

    Note: To be run on a Server installed with the Veeam Backup & Replicaton Console
    Note: There is no error checking or halt on error function
    Note: To add Linux Repository you need key based access configured and the corresponding private key file
    Note: Set desired Veeam and vCenter variables in config.json

## Requirements
- Veeam Backup & Replication Console (Update 4 in order to Configure Capacity Tier for SOBR)
- Veeam Backup & Replication Details and Credentials
- vSphere Details and Credentials
- Linux Server Details and Credentials*
- Veeam Cloud Connect Provider Credentials*
- AWS Access and Secret key along with Amazon S3 Bucket Details*

*Can be excluded from config

## Getting Started

    PARAMETER Runall - Runs all the functions
    PARAMETER RunVBRConfigure - Runs all the functions to configure the Veeam Backup & Replication Server
    PARAMETER CloudConnectOnly - Used on it's own to configure a Cloud Connect Provider 
    PARAMETER CloudConnectNEA - When used with RunAll or RunVBRConfigure will deploy and configure the Cloud Connect Network Extension Appliance
    PARAMETER NoCloudConnect - When used with RunAll or RunVBRConfigure or CloudConnectOnly will not configure the Cloud Connect component
    PARAMETER NoLinuxRepo - When used with RunAll or RunVBRConfigure will not add and configure the Linux Repository
    PARAMETER NoDefaultJobs - Will not configure Tags or Default Jobs when run with RunVBRConfigure
    PARAMETER ConfigureSOBR - Will configure a SOBR with two extents when run with RunVBRConfigure with an AWS S3 Capacity Teir
    PARAMETER NoCapacityTier - Will not configure an AWS S3 Based Object Storage Repo when used with ConfigureSOBR
    PARAMETER ClearVBRConfig - Will clear all previously configured settings and return Veeam Backup & Replication Server to default install

    EXAMPLE - PS C:\>configure_veeam.ps1 -RunVBRConfigure -NoLinuxRepo
    EXAMPLE - PS C:\>configure_veeam.ps1 -ClearVBRConfig
    EXAMPLE - PS C:\>configure_veeam.ps1 -RunVBRConfigure -ConfigureSOBR -NoCapacityTier

## config.json Breakdown
All of the variables are configured in the config.json file. Nothing is required to be changed in the main configure script.
