## Project Notes
**Author:** Timothy Dewin

**Version:** 0.1.1


You probably don't want to use it, instead:
- use veeam vbr enterprise manager if you have a simple non multitenant environment for central environment
- use veeam one if you want complete reportings
- use veeam vspc if you have a complex multitenant environment where you want to monitor everything centrally

This is only created for 2 special use case (in fact this are the 2 use cases that inspired me):
- secure environments where the means of transfering data is limited to certain protocol (email, ftp, ..)
- super low bandwidth where every byte counts and you want to have full control on how much reporting is done




## How it works
- run the localsite on every site you want to monitor on a frequent basis. make sure to change the sitename and uid in the script for every site
- json report will be dumped to c:\veeamlwr. It is your own duty to copy these files to a central location via the protocol of your liking
- put all reports on a central server under c:\veeamlwr
- run lwr-central to query the latest license status or job status (decided by the -mode parameter)
- It is your own duty to delete older files (you might want to keep them for tracking) on the central server. On the local server, auto purging happens if it is not set to 0

## Local Site 
Output should be nothing unless you add -verbose. Make sure -uniqueid is unique for every site but consistent for every run on each side
```
.\lwr-sitelocal.ps1 -uniqueid jkfjsdkjfksjkfds -sitename Main
```

## Central site
```
.\lwr-central.ps1 -mode jobquery
```
example:
```
PS C:\scripts> .\lwr-central.ps1 -mode jobquery
