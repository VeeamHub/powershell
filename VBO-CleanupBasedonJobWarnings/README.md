## Project Notes
Author: Wouter Oltlammers & Rico Wezenberg (Veeam Software)

Function: Processes specific users, recipient types, and group members, based on specific warnings generated by the VBO backup. For example, when a Shared Mailbox is deleted in O365 but is still part of a backup job, which then returns a 'Warning: User was not found)' in the VBO Job log. Based on the warning either an exclusion (GroupMember) or a removal (Individual Object) will take place.

Description: 

Processes specific users, recipient types, and group members in Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 backup jobs which are for some reason not valid anymore.

With this script, you can filter out Mailboxes or accounts that don't exist anymore. In this script, you can use multiple warning values on which checks need to be done.

For jobs created based on Group membership  (Security/Distribution, Dynamic Security Group) on which a group member cannot be processed anymore, for example when no mailbox exists anymore, will be moved to the Excluded Objects list in the VBO Job.

For jobs created based on individual objects such as users and shared mailboxes that do not exist anymore, the script will remove those specific accounts or mailboxes from the VBO Job. 

This script can run simultaneously on multiple jobs. To configure the jobs on which this script needs to check on warnings, input those jobs in the job input textfile as described in the script information.

Requires: Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 PowerShell module.
