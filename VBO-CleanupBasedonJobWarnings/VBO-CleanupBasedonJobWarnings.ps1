.NAME
    VBO-CleanupBasedonJobWarnings.ps1
.SYNOPSIS
    Processes specific users, recipient types, and group members in Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 backup jobs which are for some reason not valid anymore.
    Example scenarios: User account removed, Exchange Mailbox removed in Exchange / Exchange Online or user in group wrongfully added to VBO job, such as user-added without Mailbox. 
    Cleans up specific users and recipient types which do not exist anymore, and adds specific group members from backup jobs to the exclusion list.
    The script works based on a job input text file in which you specify for which jobs this script needs to run (line per line bases).
    The script outputs job information such as Groups and Group Members with UIDs and logs all cleanup and exclusion actions in a log file. 
    This script is tested on jobs build from Groups (Security, Distribution and Dynamic Groups), Single Users added to a job, and Dynamically added Recipient Types based on VBO-IncludeSpecificRecipientTypes.ps1 script.
.DESCRIPTION
    Script to use for removing O365 accounts in Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 backup jobs based on warnings generated in the job log.
