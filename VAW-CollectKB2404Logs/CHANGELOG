07.02 update:

  - additional checks for the presence of the Veeam Agent on the machine in question were added
  - confirmation to proceed with the logs collection if Veeam Agent is not installed was added
  - folder with the logs were renamed from "Case_Logs" to "Veeam_Case_Logs"
  - Collected logs will be saved according to the following logic:

    - if Veeam Agent is installed -> the logs will be saved to C:\ProgramData\Veeam\Veeam_Case_Logs
    - if Veeam Agent is not installed and logs collection was confirmed -> the logs will be saved to C:\Veeam_Case_Logs

13.05 update:

  - changed method for collection installed software from Get-WmiObject to faster and more reliable one
  - added information about ciphers
