# CollectKB2404Logs

# ðŸ“— Documentation

# Versions supported

This script has been tested to work on Windows Server/Workstation operating systems that use PowerShell version 2.0 or higher.

# Purpose

This script helps automate and simplify the Veeam Agent's log collection process documented in [Veeam KB2404](https://www.veeam.com/kb2404).

# Description:

Automated collection of Veeam Agent logs as well as OS related information for troubleshooting of Veeam Agent backup jobs 

# Requirements

Local Administrator permissions and permission to execute scripts in an elevated PowerShell console.

# Usage:

1) For Windows machines with an internet connection, open an Administrative PowerShell console on the Windows machine where Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows is installed and run these two lines to automatically download the log collection script to %temp% and execute it:

> 1: Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeeamHub/powershell/master/VAW-CollectKB2404Logs/CollectKB2404Logs.ps1 -o $Env:Temp\CollectKB2404Logs.ps1 

> 2: PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $env:temp\CollectKB2404Logs.ps1 
    
2) If the script was manually downloaded to the machine in question, open an Administrative PowerShell Console, and navigate to the directory where the script was saved.
    (NOTE: Running the script in PowerSell ISE is NOT supported due to the additional modules that PowerShell ISE loads that can conflict with the script's execution.)
3) Run the following to execute the script: 

  PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File "Path to the script\CollectKB2404Logs.ps1"

4) While the script runs, the PowerShell console will display information about what's happening during each step of the process.
5) At the last step the script will offer to open the folder with the log's archive - enter Y and press Enter
6) Attach the generated .zip file to the Veeam support case.
