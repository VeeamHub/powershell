## Project Notes
**Author:** Ronn Martin (ronn.martin@veeam.com)

**Function:** Add as pre-NAS backup job script for Nutanix Files SMB snapshot backup. This script simply leverages the latest hourly snapshot created by Nutanix Files for Veeam NAS backup purposes.

**Requires:** Veeam Powershell (v10 snapin, v11 module), Nutanix Files - To enable Files snapshots "Enable Self Service Restore" must be selected for the share(s) that will be targeted by Veeam for NAS backup from snapshot (hourly snapshot schedule required)

**Usage:** Copy the BR-NASBackup4NutanixFilesSMB.ps1 script to the VBR server.  From the NAS backup job "Storage" dialog select "Advanced"/"Scripts" and enable "Run the following script before the job:" Browse to the script and select.  Enclose the script path in double quotes and add the file share(s) included in the backup job e.g.

	"\Users\Administrator\Downloads\BR-NASBackup4NutanixFilesSMB.ps1" \\ntnxfs\ntnxsmb \\ntnxfs\profiles 

**Parameters:** List of shares processed by the backup job NOTE: NO trailing "\\", names must match VBR fileshare names

**Troubleshooting:**
Note that VBR Powershell interface through v10 was snapin-based.  Beginning with v11 we have switched to a Powershell module.  Be sure to adjust the script accordingly by commenting out the Veeam Powershell option that does not match your VBR platform.

If the script fails it may be run/debugged standalone as the only VBR setting changes it will effect will be the file share backup source.

The most likely cause of failure will be that the VBR backup service user context may not be authorized for Files shares.  Since Files SMB is tied to Active Directory a workgroup VBR server may not have appropriate permissions to correctly execute the following Powershell enumeration of a given share's snapshot folder.  For example -

	Get-ChildItem -Directory \\ntnxfs\ntnxsmb\.SNAPSHOT

If the preceding Powershell cmdlet does not execute correctly on the VBR server for a valid Files share the script will fail.
