## Project Notes
**Author:** Johan Huttenga (@johanhuttenga)
**Author:** Marc Cardenas (@Marc-Cardenas)

**Version:** 0.1.0.5

**Function:** Starts a PowerShell background process that watches a Veeam Backup & Replication Failover Plan. This in turn waits for virtual machines to failover and changes their IP Addresses (for Ubuntu) based on source Replication Job settings. In total this consists of three parts:

1. BR-WatchFailover which is added as a pre-failover script to a Failover Plan.
2. BR-UpdateReplicaIp which watches the Failover Plan while it executes and Re-Ips the virtual machines as they fail over.
3. BR-UpdateReplicaIpModule which contains all the dependencies required.

**Requires:** Script supports VMware vSphere only and requires Veeam Backup & Replication v11.  Re-IP rules (ReIpRulesOptions) and Guest OS credentials (VssOptions.LinCreds or VssOptions.WinCreds) have to be set in the source Replication Job. Application consistency itself can be disabled. These scripts all run in a different user space associated with the Veeam service account, which means certain defaults have to be set correctly. To allow successful connectivity this script sets PowerCLI to ignore invalid SSL certificates in this user space. If there are other defaults that need to be set in this user space be sure to address this as well.

**Usage:** 
* Add BR-WatchFailover as pre-failover script to Veeam Failover Plan. No parameters required.
* Vmware tools needs to be installed on the VM
* In powershell run ```Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted```
* In powershell run ```Install-Module VMware.PowerCLI``` if it is not installed already
